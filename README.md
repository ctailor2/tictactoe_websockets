# TicTacToe

See it in action [here](http://tictactoe-websockets.herokuapp.com/). You'll need a friend to hop on as well.

### To Do:
* Display a message to the remaining game player when the other disconnects

### Notes:
* Having the game board go from display:none to display:inline-block is causing the cucumber scenarios to occasionally fail. Look into this.
